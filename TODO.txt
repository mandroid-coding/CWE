In advance wars:
    There are four players (CWE only supports two players so far)
    One side loses when the last of its units are destroyed (CWE does not have loss conditions)
    One side also loses when its Capitol is captured.
    Fog of war exists,
    Infantry/mech have +3 vision on mountains,
    Air units can always see into forests and reefs within range,
    Other units must be adjacent to reveal forests and reefs
    Units use fuel when they move (unknown if CWE supports movement yet)
    Units display their health (1-10) on their sprite (transparent number)
    
Ensure the following exist:
    Unit movement, attacks
    Buying, repairing units.
    Handing off the turn to the next player
    Refreshing controlled units at the beginning of a turn
